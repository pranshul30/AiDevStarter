    Based on the following project description, identify the essential Python packages needed to get started.
    Return your answer as a JSON object with a single key "packages" which contains a list of the package names.
    
    Do not include packages that are part of the standard Python library (e.g., os, sys).
    Only include the base packages needed. For example, for a "fastapi web server", you only need "fastapi" and "uvicorn".

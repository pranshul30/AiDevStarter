# AiDevStarter
This repository contains the core backend engine for the AI-Dev Starter, an intelligent project scaffolding tool. It uses a Large Language Model (Gemini 1.5 ) to automatically determine the necessary dependencies for a new Python project, sets up a virtual environment, and installs everything for you, all through a simple command-line interface.
